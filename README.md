# OnlineDoc
OnlineDoc is a web application designed to help users predict the likelihood of having diabetes or heart disease. By using advanced machine learning models, the app takes input about various health factors—like glucose levels, blood pressure, and age—and provides immediate predictions based on this information. 
The user-friendly interface allows individuals to enter their health details easily. After submitting their information, users receive quick feedback about their health status. OnlineDoc aims to raise awareness about these conditions and encourage people to seek medical advice when necessary.
